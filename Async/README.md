# Async Workbench

## Overview

This repository contains examples of different ways to handle asynchronous operations in C#. The examples focus on executing tasks in both serial and parallel manners, demonstrating the impact on performance and how to efficiently handle varying task completion times.

## Methods

### Serial

Executes tasks serially, waiting for each task to complete before starting the next one.

### ParallelWithWhenAll

Executes all tasks in parallel and waits for all of them to complete before processing the results.

### ParallelWithWaitAll

Similar to `ParallelWithWhenAll`, but uses `Task.WaitAll` to wait for all tasks to complete. This approach blocks the calling thread until all tasks are done.

### ParallelWithWhenAny

Executes tasks in parallel and processes each task's result as soon as it finishes. This approach works well for tasks with high return time variation.

### ParallelWithForeachWait

Executes tasks serially by iterating through a list of tasks and waiting for each to complete. This approach is inefficient when there is high return time variation, as the overall execution time is determined by the slowest task.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates various approaches to handling asynchronous operations in C#, highlighting the impact of different strategies on performance and efficiency. By understanding and using these approaches, you can optimize the handling of tasks with varying completion times in your applications.
